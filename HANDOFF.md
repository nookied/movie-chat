# Handoff

## Latest pass (2026-04-30 — text wrap fix)

### What changed

**Fixes**
- `components/PopularMovieCard.tsx` — Text wrapping clip: Replaced block layout with flexbox and set a strict `min-h-[2.5rem]` on the title. This prevents WebKit grid intrinsic height bugs from horizontally cropping titles that wrap to a second line.

## Previous pass (2026-04-24 — bug-hunt + refactor sweep)

### What changed

Following the Electron removal, the same session did a repo-wide review: explore agent + plan agent produced 20 candidate findings; 6 were validated as real fixes, the rest were rejected (speculative, minor, or already intentional).

**Security**
- `app/api/files/diskspace/route.ts` — Path-prefix bypass: the allowlist check was bare `startsWith()`, so a configured `libraryDir=/media/lib` authorised `/media/library-private`. Now uses `path.resolve()` + `startsWith(base + path.sep)` for exact or true-child matches only. New `__tests__/api-diskspace.test.ts` locks the behaviour.

**Fixes**
- `app/api/setup/status/route.ts` — Was reading via `readConfig()`, which ignores env-var installs. Switched to `cfg()` so `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `OLLAMA_MODEL` count toward "complete" and stop triggering the `/setup` redirect.
- `app/api/config/route.ts` — Looked up `diagnosticsToken` under env var `DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN`, while `/api/diagnostics/bundle` reads `MOVIE_CHAT_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN`. Aligned both on `MOVIE_CHAT_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN`.
- `lib/directTitleLookup.ts` — `"What's Up, Doc?"` was being rejected because the early-return guard dropped any title ending in `?`. Added an internal `allowQuestionMark` option gated on the quoted call sites — unquoted question-shaped input is still rejected.
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`, `app/api/openrouter/test/route.ts` — `HTTP-Referer` is now the stable `https://github.com/nookied/movie-chat` instead of a dynamic value.

**Refactor**
- `lib/version.ts` (new) — Extracted the duplicate `getVersion()` that both `/api/config` and `/api/diagnostics/bundle` carried inline. Intentionally not cached — tests override `fs` mid-file, so a module-load cache breaks test isolation (hit this once and reverted).

**Tests added**
- `__tests__/api-diskspace.test.ts` — 5 tests (exact match, true child, sibling-prefix rejection, relative path, missing param).
- `__tests__/api-config.test.ts` — asserts `cfg()` is invoked with `['diagnosticsToken', 'MOVIE_CHAT_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN']`.
- `__tests__/setup.test.ts` — 3 tests under `/api/setup/status route — env-var fallback`.
- `__tests__/direct-title-lookup.test.ts` — 3 tests for quoted-title question-mark handling.

**Rejected findings (worth recording)**
Out of 20 candidate issues, 14 were rejected after verification:
- `autoMove` `movedCount` increment — documented deliberate behaviour, not a bug.
- OAuth PKCE verifier "unused" — verifier is used by the callback per PKCE spec.
- Regex "ReDoS" on the strip regex — not backtracking quadratically when measured.
- Other speculative cleanup / micro-opts that didn't justify the churn.

### Validation

```
npm run lint   # pass, 0 warnings
npm test       # 36 files / 644 tests — all green (up from 632)
npm run build  # clean
```

### Known follow-ups

- `version.ts` could be cached if test isolation is handled (e.g. via `vi.resetModules()` awareness). Not worth the complexity right now — the fs read is negligible.
- 14 rejected findings are not silently dropped — they're captured in this block so the next pass doesn't re-surface them as "new" signal.

## Previous pass (2026-04-24 — Electron desktop app removed)

### What changed

**Removal** — Dropped the `.dmg` distribution path entirely. Install `.sh` one-liner is now the only supported route.

Deleted:
- `electron/` (main.js, setup.js, setup.html, preload.js, icon.icns)
- `electron-builder.yml`

Edited:
- `package.json` — dropped `main`, `electron:dev`, `electron:build`, `release` scripts; dropped `electron`, `electron-builder`, `electron-updater` deps. Lockfile regenerated (437 packages, down from previous tree with Electron)
- `docs/index.html` — rewrote landing page around the `install.sh` one-liner; removed the GitHub-API-based `.dmg` asset lookup and the "no Terminal" messaging; secondary CTAs now point at the repo and README
- `README.md` — removed Option A (desktop app) and collapsed the three-option install section into a single "one-liner + manual" pair; dropped desktop-updater / desktop-uninstall sub-sections; dropped `electron:*` / `release` from the scripts reference; bumped version banner 2.2.0 → 2.3.0
- `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` — dropped the 4 `electron/` rows from the key-files table; replaced the "Electron desktop app" section with a minimal "Setup wizard" note; dropped the "Electron desktop app" deployment subsection; trimmed the landing-page deployment entry to reflect the install-command CTA; rewrote the logger log-directory resolution entry so `MOVIE_CHAT_LOG_DIR` is described as a generic override rather than Electron-specific; dropped the `electron.jsonl` caps sentence
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` — dropped "Electron lifecycle refactors" from the Non-goals list
- `CHANGELOG.md` — added `[Unreleased] → Removed` entry capturing the rationale (Gatekeeper without code signing, Homebrew-based first-run brittleness, single-maintainer test footprint)
- `lib/logger.ts` — removed stale "set by electron/main.js" comment in the log-dir resolution header
- `next.config.mjs` — updated stale "Required for Electron packaging" comment; `output: 'standalone'` is kept because pm2 deploys still benefit from the self-contained server bundle
- `.gitignore` + `.eslintignore` — dropped `dist-electron` entries
- `__tests__/setup.test.ts` — landing-page integrity test now checks for the `install.sh` one-liner CTA instead of a `.dmg` GitHub-API script
- `__tests__/diagnostics-bundle.test.ts` + `__tests__/logger.test.ts` — replaced `electron.jsonl` / `electron.1.jsonl` fixture filenames with generic `custom.jsonl` / `custom.1.jsonl` (no behaviour change — tests exercise directory-reading and prune-regex logic with any non-matching filename)

### Rationale

Three structural issues drove the decision, not a single install bug: (1) `electron-builder.yml` had `identity: null`, so every first-open hit macOS Gatekeeper; fixing this requires an Apple Developer cert ($99/year) plus a notarization flow. (2) `electron/setup.js` tried to install Plex, Transmission, and Ollama via Homebrew across arbitrary Mac configurations — the testing matrix (clean VM, partial pre-install, multiple macOS versions) is impractical for a single maintainer with no macOS CI runner. (3) Every release required a manual `GH_TOKEN=<token> npm run release` from one machine, so regressions were caught by users rather than CI.

The bare-metal `install.sh` path was already tested in CI (`__tests__/shell-scripts.test.ts`) and is architecturally simpler.

### Validation

```
npm install    # 437 packages (down from ~600+ with Electron)
npm run lint   # pending — see below
npm test       # pending — see below
```

### Known follow-ups

- No off-ramp shipped for any existing `.dmg` users still on the auto-updater. If anyone has the old build installed, they'll silently stop receiving updates. Release was already taken down by the user before this pass, so any existing installs are already detached from the update feed.
- Memory entry describing the `npm run release` / `GH_TOKEN` workflow needs to be deleted (handled during this pass).

## Previous pass (2026-04-21 — Newest tab sort fixes + panel layout)

### What changed

**Fix** — Newest tab "Sort by popularity" was actually sorting by `rating` (IMDb score), not popularity. Renamed it to "Sort by rating" and added a genuine "Sort by popularity" option backed by `sort_by=seeds` (active seeders = real-time demand proxy, distinct from all-time `download_count` used by the Most Downloaded tab). The `seeds` sort was already whitelisted in the API route and in `YtsPopularSortBy` — only `NEWEST_SUB_SORTS` in `PopularMoviesPanel.tsx` needed updating.

**Layout** — Tab buttons (Most Downloaded / Newest) and their filter/sort controls were on a single horizontally-scrolling `flex-nowrap` row, so there was no visual separation between the two concerns. Split into two rows: tabs on row 1, controls on row 2.

Files changed: `components/PopularMoviesPanel.tsx`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` (key-files table updated to reflect both changes).

### Validation

```
npm run lint   # pass, 0 warnings
npm test       # 35 files / 632 tests — pass (no new tests needed; changes are UI-only wiring and label corrections)
```

---

## Latest pass (2026-04-19 — year range filter + hover strip fix)

### What changed

**Feature** — Most Downloaded year filter replaced with 7 closed 5-year ranges:
- Top bucket: nearest multiple-of-5 at or below the current year → "2025 and later" (`min` only)
- 5 closed mid-buckets: 2020–2024, 2015–2019, 2010–2014, 2005–2009, 2000–2004
- Bottom: "Before 2000" (`max` only)
- Plus "Any year" (no filter) — 8 total items in the dropdown

`maximumYear` support was threaded through the full stack:
- `types/index.ts` → `YtsPopularOptions.maximumYear?: number`
- `lib/yts.ts` → `fetchPopularMovies` parses it; both `minimumYear` and `maximumYear` gate the over-fetch path; filter checks both bounds
- `app/api/yts/popular/route.ts` → parses and validates `maximum_year` query param (same guard as `minimum_year`)
- `components/PopularMoviesPanel.tsx` → state changed from `minYear: number` to `yearValue: string` (encodes both bounds); sends both params to the API; tab reset clears `yearValue`

**Bug fix** — `components/PopularMovieCard.tsx`: added `overflow-hidden` to the inner `div.relative.aspect-[2/3]` poster container. The `group-hover:scale-105` zoom leaked outside that div, producing a visible strip between the poster and the title bar on hover.

### Validation

```
npm test    # 35 files / 632 tests — pass (no new tests needed; filter logic is UI-only wiring)
```

---

## Previous pass (2026-04-19 — post-refactor bug hunt + simplify sweep)

Ran a deep bug-hunt across the whole branch (`recommended-movies` vs `main`), fixed everything found, then ran the `simplify` skill (three parallel review agents) and fixed the real findings. All of this lands on top of the Node-guard removal described in the pass below.

### What changed in this pass

**Bug-hunt fixes** (each independently reviewed and committed to the working tree):

1. Recommendation card refetch storm from inline-arrow identity churn (`components/chat/ChatMessageList.tsx`) — extracted `ChatMessageItem` / `RecommendationSlot` sub-components so `onResolveRecommendation` and `isDownloading` are memoised per-slot. Cards stop thrashing mid-stream.
2. `&` dropped in EZTV/Knaben title normalisation (`lib/eztv.ts`) — `norm()` now maps `&` → ` and `, so "Law & Order" matches "Law.and.Order" releases.
3. `&` dropped in Plex subtitle match (`lib/plex.ts`) — `titleMatches()` subtitle-variant check now compares normalised forms on both `title` and `originalTitle`.
4. `strictYear` lost between LLM tag and UI (`lib/chatTags.ts`) — `extractRecommendations` now propagates the flag and `recommendationTag` serialises it back out.
5. Redundant `type === 'movie'` gate on post-move re-check URL (`hooks/useRecommendationCardState.ts`).
6. Diagnostics bundle passing `''` as `envVar` to `cfg()` (`app/api/diagnostics/bundle/route.ts`) — now uses `MOVIE_CHAT_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN`.
7. ASCII-only title-case of Unicode titles (`lib/directTitleLookup.ts`) — switched to `\p{Ll}` Unicode property escapes.
8. Movie vs TV sharing a React key when title+year match (`lib/mediaKeys.ts`) — `recommendationKey` includes `type`.
9. `[^>]*` greedy regex in `stripChatActionTags` (`lib/chatTags.ts`) — swapped to lazy `[\s\S]*?` so JSON payloads containing `>` can't leak.
10. Pending torrent / forced-library collision for same-title movie vs TV (torrent/download keys now include `mediaType`).

**Simplify pass** (code review for reuse, quality, efficiency):

1. Shared YTS genre whitelist extracted to `lib/ytsGenres.ts`; consumed by `components/PopularMoviesPanel.tsx` (UI) and `app/api/yts/popular/route.ts` (validator). Prevents drift.
2. Shared rate-limiter factory extracted to `lib/rateLimit.ts`; consumed by both `/api/chat` and `/api/yts/popular`. Added a 10k soft cap on tracked IPs that forces a prune and evicts oldest entries under burst.
3. Collapsed `pendingTorrentKey` into `torrentKey(title, year?, mediaType?, season?)` — one function, optional season suffix.
4. `useDownloadTrigger` short-circuits on exact-key hit; the Map scan only runs on a miss instead of unconditionally.
5. Removed dead `controller.signal.reason !== 'timeout'` branches in `components/ShareButton.tsx` (reason was never set to `'timeout'`).
6. Scoped `ROLLBACK_LOG` variable into `rollback()` in `update.sh`.
7. Trimmed a 3-line StrictMode narrative comment in `hooks/useChatSendMessage.ts` down to one line.

### Validation on this checkout (2026-04-19, Node 24.14.1)

```

No blockers found. `HANDOFF.md` "Still open" list below remains accurate — this pass did not touch SEC-1, CR-4, RE-2, or RE-3/4.

## Previous pass (2026-04-19 — Node-version guard removed, install.sh auto-installs Node)

The previous pass shipped a guard that hard-failed on any Node major other than `20` or `24`, and a later pass relaxed it to warn-and-continue. This pass removes the guard entirely after re-investigating its motivating evidence:

- The original block was justified by a single `next build` hang observed once on Node 25.9 during a CI rerun. Re-ran `npm run ci` on Node `25.9.0` on this checkout: lint + coverage + build + e2e all green in ~32s. The hang was transient/environmental, not a real Node 25 incompatibility.
- Deleted `scripts/check-node-version.mjs`.
- `package.json` no longer prefixes `dev`, `build`, `start`, `ci`, `test:e2e`, `electron:dev`, `electron:build`, or `release` with `npm run node:check`.
- `install.sh` / `setup.sh` / `update.sh` now just print the detected Node version with no branching; they still fail fast if `node` isn't on `PATH`.
- `install.sh` now **auto-installs** Node.js when missing — via `brew install node` on macOS and the NodeSource setup script on Linux (`apt-get` / `dnf` / `yum`, `sudo` required). No interactive prompt; installing a runtime is part of the one-liner's contract. Aborts cleanly if the OS/package manager is unsupported.
- `__tests__/shell-scripts.test.ts` — the old "unsupported Node fast-fail" test is rewritten to "proceeds on any Node version without gating" and just asserts git activity after the node-version check.
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `HANDOFF.md` / `.agents/skills/qa/SCENARIOS.md` all updated to drop the stale 20/22/24 branching language.

CI still runs against Node 20 and Node 24 in `.github/workflows/test.yml`, so the supported/verified matrix hasn't changed — we just no longer block anyone outside it.

## Previous pass (2026-04-19 — codex co-review + doc sweep)

Re-ran the full verification pipeline on this checkout (Node 24.14.1), confirmed the `npm run ci` hang reported in an earlier pass does not reproduce, and brought the maintainer docs back into sync after the CI / e2e / Node-policy changes. (The `node:check` guard discussed here has since been removed entirely — see the latest pass above.)

### What changed

1. **`vitest.config.ts` / `vitest.e2e.config.ts` now exclude `.claude/**`**: a stale `.claude/worktrees/exciting-vaughan-6d362b` worktree (merged PR #13 branch) was being scanned by the default include pattern, so every `npm test` run was picking up a second duplicated copy of the old test tree and reporting 5 spurious failures from commits that have since been fixed. Both configs now skip the worktree roots so the test suite reports only the real tree.
2. **`CLAUDE.md` resynced with `AGENTS.md`**: added the missing `lib/mediaKeys.ts` / `lib/recUrlParam.ts` rows, replaced the stale `fetchPopularMovies` over-fetch description with the accumulated-pagination model actually in `lib/yts.ts`, updated `DownloadTracker` / `ShareButton` / `directTitleLookup` / `chatTags` / `plex` entries, refreshed the test count to 35 files / 632 tests, and added the Node 20/24 runtime policy + CI / e2e section so `CLAUDE.md` no longer lags behind `AGENTS.md`.
3. **`.agents/skills/qa/SCENARIOS.md` aligned with the shipped code**: corrected test counts per file, updated the total to 35 files / 632 tests, rewrote the Popular-movies P4 row to describe multi-page filtered pagination instead of the old single-page hit-rate estimate, and removed the legacy "OAuth without state is allowed" SEC10 row since the compat bypass was removed.
4. **`HANDOFF.md` refreshed**: removed the "remaining follow-up" entry for the `npm run ci` → `next build` hang and added this pass. Previous passes retained in-place.

### Validation on this checkout (2026-04-19, Node 24.14.1)

npm test              # 35 files / 632 tests — pass

```

### Code-review notes (second opinion on the codex sweep)

Full re-read of the files touched by `b9c7174`, `0dc35ce`, `1dc698c`, and `4f3c9f9`:

- `components/ShareButton.tsx` — the `if (hostname !== 'localhost' …)` / `else` branches assign the same fallback in both paths, but the `else` branch then tries to upgrade to `<hostname>.local` via `/api/setup/hostname`. The branches are not redundant; preserving the structure intentionally.
- `components/DownloadTracker.tsx` — the `abortInFlightRequest()` call is ordered before the new `AbortController` assignment; an in-flight fetch from the previous controller sees `AbortError` and is caught at line 74, so there's no real race window when the component re-runs quickly.
- `lib/yts.ts` `fetchPopularMovies()` — math is sound: exact `totalCount` at end-of-scan, otherwise `max(filteredSeen, round(rawTotalCount * (filteredSeen / rawSeen)))`.
- `hooks/useChatHistory.ts` — load-effect uses a functional updater so URL-injected `?rec=` recommendations no longer get clobbered by localStorage load.
- Shell-script tests confirm `update.sh --auto` proceeds on any Node version without gating (updated to match the relaxed policy).

No blockers found in this pass.

## Previous pass (2026-04-19 — regression sweep, testing expansion, handoff prep)

Closed the biggest regressions found in the post-Claude sweep, expanded automated verification into a real CI-shaped pipeline, and aligned the maintainer docs with the shipped behavior. The final wrap-up verification on this machine landed in a mixed state on the original Node 25.9.0 runtime: `npm run lint` and `npm test` passed on the finished tree, while a fresh `npm run ci` rerun cleared lint + coverage and then hung inside `next build` before producing `.next/BUILD_ID`. That hang was the original motivation for a Node-version guard; re-investigation in the latest pass showed it doesn't reproduce and the guard has been removed.

### What changed

1. **Automated testing + CI now covers the full release path**
   - Replaced `next lint` with CI-safe `eslint . --ext .js,.mjs,.ts,.tsx` so lint is non-interactive locally and in GitHub Actions.
   - Added enforced Vitest global coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`.
   - Added `vitest.e2e.config.ts` + `__e2e__/app-smoke.test.ts` so we boot the built standalone app and hit core routes over real HTTP.
   - Added `npm run ci` as the local mirror of GitHub Actions and updated `.github/workflows/test.yml` to run `lint` → `test:coverage` → `build` → `test:e2e`.
   - CI now runs on both Node 20 and Node 24, while `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, and `package.json#engines` pin the repo to tested LTS majors instead of following unsupported current releases.
2. **`/popular` browse flow is now pagination-correct and race-safe**
   - `lib/yts.ts` no longer filters a single raw YTS page and hopes the math works out. When `minimumYear` is set, it now accumulates filtered results across raw YTS pages until it can fill the requested filtered page, then returns an exact `totalCount` if it reached the end or a bounded estimate otherwise.
   - `components/PopularMoviesPanel.tsx` now routes debounce, pagination, and retry through one request path with abort + request-id guards, so stale responses can no longer overwrite newer tab/filter/page state.
   - The visible "Showing X-Y of Z" range is clamped to the actual rendered card count.
3. **Popular-card handoff now preserves exact movie identity**
   - `components/PopularMovieCard.tsx` adds `strictYear: true` to the `?rec=` payload.
   - `lib/recUrlParam.ts` preserves that flag only when the year is valid, so remake titles clicked from `/popular` stay locked to the intended movie all the way through chat, Plex checks, and YTS search.
4. **Download bookkeeping no longer collides across movie/TV name matches**
   - `lib/mediaKeys.ts` now keys torrent/download state by `mediaType + title + year`, not just `title + year`.
   - `usePendingTorrents`, `useDownloadTrigger`, `useAppDownloads`, `DownloadTracker`, `RecommendationCard`, `DownloadsPanel`, `ChatMessageList`, and `useRecommendationCardState` were updated so a movie and TV show sharing title/year do not steal each other’s pending/downloaded state.
5. **Stale async work was tightened up in the two remaining weak spots**
   - `components/DownloadTracker.tsx` now aborts in-flight status polls and suppresses the "Added to library" path after a user-initiated cancel, so a stale "not found" response cannot misclassify a canceled torrent as moved.
   - `components/ShareButton.tsx` now preserves protocol/origin correctly, avoids stale cached QR state across origin changes, cancels the QR promise chain on close/unmount, and handles clipboard write failures quietly.
6. **Regression coverage was added for the risky fixes**
   - `__tests__/yts-popular.test.ts` covers multi-page filtered pagination and exact filtered `totalCount` at end-of-scan.
   - `__tests__/media-keys.test.ts` covers movie-vs-TV torrent key separation.
   - `__tests__/recUrlParam.test.ts` covers `strictYear` preservation through the `?rec=` handoff.
7. **Node/runtime policy is now explicit** (note: later relaxed — see the latest pass)
   - `install.sh` and `setup.sh` originally required Node 20 or 24 LTS, with 24 recommended; `update.sh` added a corresponding guard before git/npm work.
   - While landing those guards, the shell test suite caught a real `set -e` footgun in `update.sh`; the updater now uses explicit `if` blocks instead of bare `[ ... ] && ...` checks in auto-mode branches (this fix is preserved).

### Remaining follow-ups worth watching

- `SEC-1` diagnostics token exposure via `GET /api/config`
- `CR-4` `ThinkFilter` dropping buffered content on unclosed `<think>`
- Torrent-search result caching in `lib/yts.ts` / `lib/eztv.ts`

## Previous pass (2026-04-19 — popular-movies browse UX)

Shipped the `/popular` YTS browse feature with tab-specific controls, cleaned up a recommendation-injection race in chat history, and raised the YTS popular-list cache TTL to 4h. All 618 tests pass, production build is clean.

### What changed

1. **Popular Movies browse tab** (`/popular`) splits controls by sort mode:
   - **Most Downloaded** (default): genre + minimum-release-year filter dropdowns.
   - **Newest**: a single sort-order dropdown — *Sort by year* (default) or *Sort by popularity*. Both variants are hard-scoped to the last 3 years via `NEWEST_MIN_YEAR = currentYear - 3`, applied server-side as `minimum_year`. This stops *Sort by popularity* from surfacing all-time high-rated concerts / kids titles from any decade, which defeats the point of a "Newest" tab. The scope is deliberately not user-tunable — add a control only if someone actually asks for it.
   - Switching tabs resets `genre`, `minYear`, and `newestSort` so stale state from the other tab can't linger.
2. **Card chrome trimmed** (`components/PopularMovieCard.tsx`): removed the per-card `1080p` quality badge and the `opacity-60` dim state for non-1080p entries — YTS always has a 1080p variant in practice, so the badge was redundant noise.
3. **YTS popular-list cache TTL** bumped 1800s → 14400s (4h) in `lib/yts.ts` (`POPULAR_CACHE_SECONDS`). `/popular` was previously refetching every 30 min for no user benefit. Next.js fetch cache invalidates naturally on `npm run build`, so no migration is needed.
4. **`minimumYear` filter groundwork** (`lib/yts.ts`): YTS API has no year filter, so the initial ship over-fetched and client-side filtered. The follow-up pass above replaced the single-page hit-rate estimate with accumulated filtered pagination across raw pages.
5. **Chat history race fix** (`hooks/useChatHistory.ts`): the localStorage load effect was clobbering any URL-injected recommendation because it called `setMessages(valid)` non-functionally on mount, racing with the `ChatInterface` effect that reads `?rec=` from the URL. Now the loader uses a functional updater that preserves any messages already present (other than the welcome placeholder).
6. **Suspense wrap on ChatInterface** (`app/page.tsx`): required by `useSearchParams()` — the previous setup was silently building but prerender-warning.
7. **Tests**: +12 added for the new `minimumYear` groundwork, cache TTL, and API-route param clamping; later expanded again by the regression/CI pass above.

### Files touched

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `components/PopularMoviesPanel.tsx` | Tab-specific controls; `NEWEST_MIN_YEAR` scoping; filter reset on tab switch |
| `components/PopularMovieCard.tsx` | Removed 1080p badge + dimming |

| `types/index.ts` | `minimumYear?: number` on `YtsPopularOptions`; `YtsPopularSortBy` includes `'year'` and `'rating'` |
| `hooks/useChatHistory.ts` | Load effect now merges vs clobbers |
| `app/page.tsx` | `<Suspense fallback={null}>` around `ChatInterface` |
| `__tests__/yts-popular.test.ts` | Over-fetch + TTL + year-filter coverage |
| `__tests__/api-yts-popular.test.ts` | `minimum_year` param clamping |

### Validation

```
npm test              # 34 files / 618 tests passing
npm run build         # clean production build; /popular is 2.79 kB static
```

### Dev-mode footgun worth knowing about

Rapid edits while `npm run dev` is running can corrupt the webpack dev build so the CSS chunk isn't served (the back-arrow SVG renders at its natural 24×24 size scaled up because `w-5 h-5` silently no-ops) or `pages-manifest.json` goes missing and every route 500s. Fix: stop the dev server, `rm -rf .next`, restart. Does not affect `npm run build` or production.

### Migration notes for existing users (v2.x → now)

- `localStorage['movie-chat-history']` schema unchanged — safe.
- YTS cache TTL bump has no runtime effect; `npm run build` clears the Next fetch cache.
- `minimum_rating` param is still parsed by `/api/yts/popular` (kept on the route for forward-compat) but the UI no longer surfaces it — the Newest tab now exposes sort order, not a rating filter. No URL-param breakage.
- `config.local.json` schema unchanged.

## Previous pass (2026-04-19 — post-refactor bug hunt)

This session reviewed the codebase looking for regressions introduced by the v2.1.0 / v2.2.0 refactors (chat split into hooks, recommendation card split into a hook + sub-components) and landed nine fixes in priority order.

### Fixes landed (priority order)

1. **CRITICAL — Recommendation card refetch storm** (`components/chat/ChatMessageList.tsx`). Inline `(next) => onResolveRecommendation(message.id, index, next)` and `(season) => isRecommendationDownloading(recommendation, season)` arrows were new objects on every `ChatInterface` render (each keystroke, each streaming token), cascading into `useRecommendationCardState`'s main effect deps and refiring Plex / reviews / torrent fetches. Extracted `ChatMessageItem` (per-message) and `RecommendationSlot` (per-recommendation) so the wrappers are memoised with stable deps. This was the likely root cause of several "flickering / slow / stuck-loading" reports.
2. **HIGH — TV shows with `&` missed on Knaben** (`lib/eztv.ts`). `norm()` now converts `&` → ' and ' before stripping non-alphanumerics (matches `lib/yts.ts` and `lib/plex.ts`).
3. **HIGH — Plex subtitle match failed on `&`** (`lib/plex.ts`). `titleMatches()` subtitle-variant `startsWith` check now normalises both sides and also covers `originalTitle`.
4. **MEDIUM — `strictYear` dropped from LLM tags** (`lib/chatTags.ts`). `extractRecommendations` carries `strictYear: true` from the JSON payload; `recommendationTag` serialises it.
5. **MEDIUM — Inconsistent strict-year param between initial and post-move Plex check** (`hooks/useRecommendationCardState.ts`). Post-move re-check now builds its URL the same way as the first check.
6. **MEDIUM — Diagnostics bundle `cfg()` envVar** (`app/api/diagnostics/bundle/route.ts`). Uses `MOVIE_CHAT_DIAGNOSTICS_TOKEN` instead of `''`, so the token can be overridden by env in proxied deployments.
7. **MEDIUM — Unicode titles in direct-title lookup** (`lib/directTitleLookup.ts`). `capitalizeWord` and `maybeTitleCase` use `\p{Ll}` instead of `[a-z]`, so "über" / "élite" title-case properly.
8. **LOW — Movie/TV key collision** (`lib/mediaKeys.ts`). `recommendationKey` includes `type` so same-title same-year movie vs TV shows don't share a React key.
9. **LOW — Self-closing-tag strip regex hardened** (`lib/chatTags.ts`). `stripChatActionTags` uses lazy `[\s\S]*?` instead of `[^>]*` for malformed payloads, so JSON containing `>` can't break the strip.

## Previous pass (2026-04-16 — code review, bug fixes, documentation audit)

This session did a full codebase review after several merges and refactors, fixed three issues found, updated all documentation to match current code, and ran a simplify/quality pass on the fixes.

## Key changes

### Security fixes

- **OAuth CSRF + URL hijack** (`app/api/openrouter/auth/route.ts`, `app/api/openrouter/callback/route.ts`): New auth initiation route generates a random state token stored in an httpOnly cookie. The callback verifies the state with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`. All redirects use a fixed `APP_ORIGIN` (env `INTERNAL_APP_ORIGIN` or `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>`) instead of reflecting the client Host header.
- **Body size limit + JSON error handling** (`lib/requestBody.ts`): All POST routes reject requests over 64 KB (413) and return 400 on malformed JSON.
- **IP spoofing hardened** (`lib/requestIp.ts`): LAN guard and rate limiter use the last hop of `X-Forwarded-For` instead of the first.
- **Atomic config writes** (`lib/config.ts`): `writeConfig` uses write-to-temp + `renameSync` to prevent corruption.
- **Path traversal guard** (`lib/moveFiles.ts`): `assertWithinDir` check before `fs.rm` prevents a maliciously-named torrent from wiping the download directory. Symlinks are rejected.
- **Middleware SSRF fix** (`middleware.ts`): Internal setup-status URL uses a fixed origin instead of reflecting `req.url`.
- **Input validation** (`app/api/transmission/add/route.ts`): `mediaType` enum, `season` non-negative integer, `title` length limit (500), `year` range (1888–3000).

### Bug fixes

- **Stream reader leak** (`app/api/chat/route.ts`): Added `reader.cancel()` in `finally` block so upstream LLM streams are closed when the client disconnects.
- **Stale closure in DownloadTracker** (`components/DownloadTracker.tsx`): `fetchStatus` now lists all referenced props in its deps array.
- **Inline function identity** (`components/DownloadsPanel.tsx`): Extracted `DownloadTrackerWrapper` with `useCallback`-memoized `onComplete` to stop poll timer resets.
- **File move data loss** (`lib/moveFiles.ts`): On `unlink` failure the rollback no longer deletes the destination copy.

### Update script hardened (`update.sh`)

- PID-based lock file (`.update.lock`) prevents concurrent cron runs; stale locks auto-cleaned
- `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
- Dirty-worktree detection with optional stash
- Rollback on pull/install/build failure: `git reset --hard` + rebuild + pm2 restart
- Post-restart health check: polls `/api/setup/status` up to 5 times

### Movie disambiguation & strictYear (from v2.2.0)

- Bare movie titles with multiple TMDB matches show a `MovieMatchChooser` instead of picking arbitrarily
- Once the user picks, `strictYear: true` propagates through the entire flow (reviews → Plex check → torrent search → download) so metadata, availability, and downloads all lock to the same movie
- New types: `MovieDisambiguationCandidate`, `ReviewLookupResponse.ambiguityCandidates/resolvedRecommendation`, `Recommendation.strictYear`
- New lib: `resolveMovieLookup` (tmdb.ts), `searchLibraryWithOptions` (plex.ts), `searchTorrents` strictYear option (yts.ts)

### Refactor (from first pass)

- `lib/chat/systemMessages.ts` — all `[System]` message strings centralised
- `lib/mediaKeys.ts` — title normalisation, key generation, capped-set helpers
- `lib/requestBody.ts`, `lib/requestIp.ts`, `lib/randomId.ts` — shared utilities
- `components/ChatInterface.tsx` — ~150-line composition root over focused hooks
- `components/RecommendationCard.tsx` — ~190-line layout (grew with disambiguation); all data fetching in `useRecommendationCardState` (~517 lines)
- `hooks/` — `useChatHistory`, `useChatSendMessage`, `useAppDownloads`, `usePendingTorrents`, `useDownloadTrigger`, `useRecommendationCardState` with AbortController cleanup

## Validation

```
npx vitest run        # 31 files / 569 tests passing
npx tsc --noEmit      # clean (zero errors)
npm run build         # clean production build
```

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build && pm2 restart movie-chat
```

Prompt changes require a server restart. Config changes are hot-reloaded (30s cache).

## Remaining audit items

### Still open

- **SEC-1** `app/api/config/route.ts` — `diagnosticsToken` returned in plaintext via `GET /api/config`. Any LAN device can retrieve it and download the full chat-log bundle. Deferred because the Settings page UI depends on it. Fix: serve the token only through a server-rendered page, not the JSON config endpoint.
- **CR-4** `app/api/chat/route.ts` `ThinkFilter` — If the LLM emits `<think>` without a closing tag, trailing buffered content is silently dropped. Add a `flush()` method.
- **RE-2** `app/api/diagnostics/bundle/route.ts` — Reads all log files into memory at once (~100 MB peak). Reduce `MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES` or stream the response.
- **RE-3/4** `lib/yts.ts`, `lib/eztv.ts` — No server-side caching on torrent search results. Add a short TTL cache keyed by `(title, season)`.
- `forceOllama` in `/api/chat` body not validated as boolean.

### Resolved (latest bug-hunt pass, 2026-04-19)

- Recommendation card refetch storm from inline-arrow identity churn (`ChatMessageList.tsx`)
- `&` dropped in EZTV/Knaben title normalisation (`lib/eztv.ts`)
- `&` dropped in Plex subtitle `startsWith` match (`lib/plex.ts`)
- `strictYear` lost between LLM tag and UI (`lib/chatTags.ts`)
- Redundant `type === 'movie'` gate on post-move re-check URL (`hooks/useRecommendationCardState.ts`)
- Diagnostics bundle passing `''` as envVar to `cfg()` (`app/api/diagnostics/bundle/route.ts`)
- ASCII-only title-case of Unicode titles (`lib/directTitleLookup.ts`)
- Movie vs TV sharing a React key when title+year match (`lib/mediaKeys.ts`)
- `[^>]*` greedy regex in `stripChatActionTags` (`lib/chatTags.ts`)

### Resolved (audit pass, 2026-04-16)

- OAuth CSRF state bypass — `if (urlState || cookieState)` guard removed; both state values are now always required
- OpenRouter/Ollama test routes returning HTTP 200 for errors — now return 400/502 consistent with all other test routes
- TypeScript strict check failure in `__tests__/shell-scripts.test.ts` — `ProcessEnv` type mismatch fixed

### Resolved (previous sessions)

- OAuth CSRF protection (was unprotected)
- OAuth redirect URL hijack via Host header (was reflecting client header)
- Stream reader leak on disconnect (now cancelled in `finally`)
- Stale closures in DownloadTracker (deps corrected)
- Inline function identity causing timer resets (extracted wrapper)
- update.sh concurrent run risk (lock file added)
- update.sh silent failure on pipe (pipefail already set; verified correct)

## Recommended next pass

1. Fix SEC-1 (diagnostics token exposure) and CR-4 (ThinkFilter flush)
2. Chat route modularisation (`app/api/chat/route.ts` remains a single large file — see `NEXT_STEPS.md`)
3. Setup/settings workflow consolidation (see `NEXT_STEPS.md`)

## Known quirks

- `assertWithinDir` error message when `allowSameDir=false` says "outside allowed directory" — cosmetically inaccurate (path equals the root). No functional impact.
- A stale `.claude/worktrees/<name>` directory from a previous Claude Code worktree session does **not** pollute `npm test` / `npm run test:e2e` anymore (both vitest configs now exclude `.claude/**`). If you end up with one lying around, `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<name>` cleans it up.
